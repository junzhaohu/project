Final Project Outline  Junzhao Hu
========================================================
Topic Name: How to avoid incovenience in taking flight.

Below is the link for the data, I downloaded data for October, November and December of 2013.

I am interested in several things:

1 Is there a day of the week/ time of day effect on departure or arrival delays

2 Which city(Origin and Destination) cancels or delays the most.

3 Which Carrier delays or cancels most.

4 What kind of factors affect the delay time of the flight(like distance,depart time, arrive time)

5 Which company(UniqueCarrier) delays or cancels most.

6 Since we are in Ames, so we mainly take Des Moines International Airport as Origin or Destination, to find out
what kind of factors affect the delay and cancels of flight here.

Several interesting questions to be continued.

Using SQL to clean to clean the data...
